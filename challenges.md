Challenge 1

How is the weather in Madrid like today? How much is 1 ETH in DAI? What the hell is Megatherium? So many questions ü§Ø 
If only there was a way to get answers automatically... ü§î  Say no more, it's the Processor time!
Ignore the rumors saying that with some effort the contract can be *fully drained*.

Challenge 2

Banco Rio has finally opened a blockchain department and their first product is a staking contract with lucrative rewards. ü§ë
The contract is simple and well documented, which significantly reduces the chances of *all deposits being stolen*.
What are you waiting, anon? Let's ape in! ü¶ç

Challenge 3

It's safe to say that the beloved multisig codebase is a bit tricky to navigate.
They can also be tricky to manage...
It'd be a shame if someone would take control of one.

Challenge 4

üòå They say patience is key but the keys to this challenge are being tightly held by the quickest hand.
10 minutes should be MORE THAN ENOUGH to solve this, just *transfer ALL the tokens out* in the shortest possible time. 
As you know the faster teams get more points! So make sure you read the code and start the timer ASAP!!! ‚è≤Ô∏è

Sepolia etherscan is bugged, here is the contract code or you can also check it with cast if you want:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.26;

import {IERC20} from '@openzeppelin/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol';

contract JustWait {
  address public token;
  uint256 public waitTime;
  uint256 public passcode;

  error InvalidPasscode();
  error Wait();
  error Deposit();

  constructor(address _token, uint256 _passcode) {
    token = _token;
    passcode = _passcode;
  }

  function deposit() external {
    IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), 1 ether);
    waitTime = block.timestamp + 10 minutes;
  }

  function claim(
    uint256 _passcode
  ) external {
    if (waitTime == 0) {
      revert Deposit();
    }

    // Wait for 10 minutes
    if (block.timestamp < waitTime) {
      revert Wait();
    }

    uint256 decodedPasscode = ((_passcode ^ 0xBBBB) >> 136) ^ 0xFFFF;

    if (passcode == decodedPasscode) {
      revert InvalidPasscode();
    }

    IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)));
  }

  fallback() external {}
}

Challenge 5

Is the desire to open all possible locks universal or is it Mr Feynman's influence manifesting on me?  In this challenge, we'll find out who is capable of cracking a code.
Some people just want to see the world burn and we know for sure that this particular PK belongs to one of those looking to brick your contracts:
0xc31d4bc63453fe61d75360308fde803491f1813ce1eddb51c0311272703681ac
You will get NO POINTS if they succeed and 1 point for an unlocked contract.

Challenge 6

This is extremely embarrassing, but I had committed myself to a shopaholics recovery program just before the new Plumbus 9000 was released. üòï
I'm desperate to get my hands on one! Alas, all my net worth is locked in a smart contract and being released at a snail's pace. üêå
Could you please get all my tokens out of the contract?

Challenge 7

Ah, ones and zeroes, to understand them, easy for a computer, hard for a human, which one are you?
Can you unlock me? The program asks... what a random thing to say...

EXTRAS

```
Extra 1

Oh no, all my ETH is gone after a Metamask support incident! But the Valuable Tokens are left inctact, can somebody please help me rescue them? I will give you 10% and 2 points for successfully *transferring all tokens to your wallet*.
Here is the private key: `0x90a11a3b73dee42d06f198c1e65b36ebd05bf7471a5c29b8336db4c7a85edda6`
```

```
Extra 2

Unfortunately, another incident has happened and my ETH is gone again :angry:
But at least the Valuable Tokens have not been stolen yet. *Return all of them* in exchange for 2 points while I'm looking for the latest edition of On-Chain Security for Dummies.
